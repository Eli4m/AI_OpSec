## 🧪 Prompt Injection Research (Ethical Red Teaming)

As part of my exploration into AI safety, I’ve conducted responsible red teaming of various AI systems to test their robustness against adversarial prompting. The goal of this research is to better understand and demonstrate how language models can be manipulated into producing responses that bypass safety filters.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This research is shared strictly for **educational** and **awareness** purposes. No full jailbreak prompts or harmful payloads are included, and all demonstrations were conducted in a controlled environment. I do **not** endorse or support malicious use of AI technologies.
